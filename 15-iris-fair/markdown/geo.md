## GEO Submission

### About
GEO (**G**ene **E**xpression **O**mnibus) is a public data repository that 
accepts array- and high throughput sequence-based data. To submit data to GEO, 
you will need three components:

* Metadata spreadsheet
* Processed data files
* Raw data files

After submitting your data to the `DGE Analysis` tab, you can fill out this 
questionnaire which will populate the metadata template file required for GEO 
submission.
